<p><h2>About the internet</h2>
The <b>World Wide Web (www)</b> consists of <em>HTML</em>
(hyper text markup language) documents.<br>
These documents are connected via hyper links with each other. It works like <br>
this: The user sends a request by the browser on his computer via the internet <br>
to the server and receives the documents. The request are done with <em>HTTP</em> <br>
(hypertext transfer protocol). If you need more information about the internet <br>
just have a look at this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723400">video</a>.</p>

<br>
<p><h2>HTML</h2>
<strong>Computers are stupid machines</strong> which need clear orders and information for <br>
processing. <b>HTML</b> is the coding language which tells the computer what and <br>
how it has to display the content and how it has to react on specific user <br>
actions. <b>HTML</b> can be plain text, it can provide lay-outs <em>(markup)</em>, it can <br>
include other documents like pictures, videos, pdf, and it can contain links <br>
to other websites.
</p>
<br>
<p><h2>HTML markup</h2>
The <b>HTML markup</b> consists of tags which are the orders tell the computer what <br>
to do. The opening tag together with the content and (if necessary) the closing<br>
tag are one element.
</p>
<br>
<p><h2>Tag types</h2>
There are different <em>types of tags</em>. Some tags need an opening and a closing <br>
tag like “< b > <b>content</b> < / b >”. An anchor tag ads a hyper link to a defined word <br>
or phrase like this one to the Udacity homepage. You can learn more about the <br>
tag types by this fantastic <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48508417/m-48723411">video</a>.
