            The <span class="bold">World Wide Web (www)</span> consists of <span class="italic">HTML</span> (hyper text markup language) documents. These documents are connected via hyper links with each other. It works like this: The user sends a request by the browser on his computer via the internet to the server and receives the documents. The request are done with <span class="italic">HTTP</span> (hypertext transfer protocol).

            At the beginning you always start as a <span class="italic">novice</span>. To become an <span class="italic">expert</span> you have to pass several stages. As a <span class="bold">novice</span> you are at the stage of <span class="bold">ignorance</span>. Means you even don't know what you don't know. As soon as you entered the topic and get some ideas of it you are getting at the stage of <span class="bold">awareness</span> which means that you know what you don't know. From <span class="italic">ignorance</span> to <span class="italic">awareness</span> normally takes only short time, maybe minutes. After learning the key skills you are getting at the stage of <span class="bold">ability</span>. This can takes some days, weeks or months. After you got the <span class="italic">ability</span> it takes maybe years to get an <span class="bold">expert</span> by practicing your skills permanently.Another way to understand learning is to identify the differences between a novice and an expert. There is a <span class="italic">knowledge</span> and a <span class="italic">skills</span> gap. The knowledge gap can be closed by <span class="bold">reflection</span> and the skills gap by <span class="bold">practice</span>.

            During studying it is quite normal to be <span class="italic">confused or frustrated</span>. However you have to watch out that it doesn't turn into something worse like <span class="italic">disappointment, anger or terror</span>. To avoid that there are three possibilities: Ask for help, have a break or just go on.

          <p>
            Building a fancy website happens in several levels. For the strucure and the content of the website you use <span class="bold">HTML</span>. HTML works with tags which can also include other tags between the opening and closing tags. The style of the elements (opening tag + content + closing tag) is done in the language <span class="bold">CSS</span> (comparable with the decoration in a house). For interactive elements you use the language <span class="bold">java script</span>. The coding elements of a website can be seen with the <span class="italic">developer tools</span> of <span class="italic">Google Chrome</span>.

        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
            The coding of websites is organized in <span class="italic">tree-like-structures</span>. Each element is in one line. This structure is called <span class="bold">Document Object Model (DOM)</span>. For the handling of the different elements on the website you use <span class="bold">boxes</span>. In the HTML code these are signed with the tag <span class="italic">DIV</span>. Using boxes makes it much easier to reorganize the different elements on your website and to remain an overview. Boxes are always <span class="italic">rectangular</span> even if they look like a circle or something else. The layout is done in <span class="italic">CSS</span>. Regularly you use boxes in  boxes in boxes <span class="italic">(from big to small)</span>. Another method to remain an overview of your coding is to <span class="bold">label</span> your boxes so that you still know what is in it. This is especially relevant if you use images and other objects with cryptic names like "pic1". Labels are done by using <span class="italic">"class="</span> within the <span class="italic">DIV tag</span>.

          <p>
            As the style of the HTML document comes from a <span class="bold">CSS</span> file these have to be linked with each other. However first of all you have to give the computer some information like that it is an HTML document, the head and link to the CSS file and the starting point of the body. The right way to do that can be seen in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-3614428682/m-2603798584">video</a>.

        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
            A <span class="italic">cascade structure</span> is a break down structure from big to small.It actually works like a waterfall (e.g. national law – state law – city law – house rules). A big advantage of CSS is the possibility of <span class="bold">inheritance</span>. Same structure-parts can be grouped with the same name by using the parameter <span class="italic">“class”</span> and for these you can set the same style rules. This functionality <span class="italic">avoids a lot of unnecessary repeated coding</span> which means less work and less complexity. In general descendant elements inherit text-related properties like colour, font, letter spacing and so on. But there are also properties which cannot be inherited like background, border and display.

            How to include CSS style in my web page. There are actually three methods:<br>
            1.  <span class="bold">Write CSS in the head of the html file</span>. This is good for small projects.<br>
            2.  <span class="bold">Link the HTML file to a separate CSS file</span>. This is good for larger projects due to the better organization.<br>
            3.  <span class="bold">Write the style inline with your HTML</span>. This is not suggested because of much unnecessary code and the high effort of keeping it up to date.

            The box size is equal to the <span class="italic">sum of the boarder, the padding and the content</span>. The size can be written in pixels (px) or percentage. Additional you can use max width to ensure that it the box won’t destroy your layout. Another possibility is that instead of adjusting each single size of the box parts after any small change you can use the CSS code <span class="italic">“box-sizing: border-box”</span>. However you have to consider two things. First, margin is not included and second, it is a relatively new code and it has to be adjusted for different browsers. How to do that you can see in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-2771378569/m-2792478544">video</a>.

The programs are written in a specific <span class="italic">programming language</span> which is used by the programmers. The reason why using program languages and not natural languages (e.g. English, German) is the ambiguity and the verbosity of natural languages.

Like any other program language it uses a specific <span class="italic">grammar</span>. If grammar rules are broken a message regarding syntax error occur.

This means: Usage of simple and precise descriptions, replacement of non-terminal expressions until only terminal expressions are left. The replacement of non-terminal expression can be another non-terminal or a terminal expression. This structure of breaking down is called “derivation”.

        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
            Instead of using big numbers or long characters you can define variables in python. The definition works through assignment statements which is done by using the equal sign. However in python the equal-sign is used in a different way than in maths. In python it means: put the value of the right side as meaning of the expression on the left side (e.g. days = days – 1 and days = 47; the value of days is 46 in this case). If you use a variable in a formula without assignment of a value an error will occur. Variables have to be defined. Usually variables are written in small letters. It’s not a must but a usual name convention.

          <p>
            A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. Strings are used to display plain text. This can be done with single (‘x’) or double quotes (“x”). In python strings and variable can be combined like:<br>
            -> Name = Janko<br>
            -> print “hello ” + name + “!”<br>
            After the “hello” must be a space otherwise name would be directly after it. Strings and numbers cannot be combined in a sum like “hello” + 9. This would lead to an error. Even if the string is number. If you take the sum of numbers in strings it looks like this -- “2” + “2” –> result is 22. However strings can be multiplied like -- print “!” * 12 -> result is !!!!!!!!!!!!. -  Multi line strings can be created by triple single quotes like “”” or ‘’’. Then the text in the string can be written in several lines only with one print.

            By adding an index behind a variable or a string only the specific characters would be displayed. Python counts the place of each character from zero on. For example by using the index [3] the fourth character of a variable or string would be displayed. By using negative numbers as in index python counts from the back. In this case [-1] would mean the last character. Using indexes you have to consider that python does the arithmetic part first (e.g. S[3] is equal to S[1+1+1].

          <p>
            To find specific parts within a string you can use the procedure “find”. The output of the procedure is the number of the position. The usage of find looks like this – print “string”.find(“what to search for”). If nothing gets found then the output is -1. To define the position you want to search from you can add a second parameter to “find” like – “string”. Find(“string”, “8”) – means that python would search from postion 8 on. This procedure can also be used in variables to display specific parts. Here is an example of that: 
            -> my_string = "My favorite color: blue"<br>
            -> color_start_location = my_string.find("color:")<br>
            -> favorite_color = my_string[color_start_location:]<br>
            -> print favorite_color[7:]<br>
            The result of this would be “blue”. More information about the procedure can be found in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud552-nd/l-3574398630/m-48721298">video</a>.

          <p>
             With a procedure you can map inputs to outputs. To define a function you have to use the expression "def". The whole function starts with a starting line including the "def", the name of the function and the inputs (Bsp.: def "name of function" (input1, input2)). After the starting line comes the body which includes the specification what to do with the parameters. At the end of the function you have to define what has to be returned. To use the function it is now just necessary to write the name of the function, followed by the defined value-parameters in brackets. Procedures can have x inputs which are also called operands or parameter or arguments. All inputs have to be used in a procedure. If a procedure has no return then it has no value and prints out "none".

             With functions you can define a couple of programming steps which come over and over again. By using a function these steps can be done automatically with just one order like the definition of a DEV-Box in HTML. The individual content of the box would be defined by the parameters.

             By using the expression while you can repeat a process until a specified condition is fulfilled.  By using the expression if you can define specific circumstances and what to do if these are fulfilled. Example: The -block- defines the steps which have to be proceeded if the condition is fulfilled. If the condition is not fulfilled then the "return xxx" line will be processed. For Boolean results you have to include the code "print True" or "print False" (with T and F as capital letters). In case of several conditions you can use an "or" (if only one needs to be fulfilled) or "and" (if all conditions have to be fulfilled). Example: If you use "or" and the first condition is already fulfilled then python will not check the second condition. Only if the first condition is false then python would print the result of the second condition. With the expression "Max(a,b,c)" you can directly evaluate the highest value of a, b and c.

             With the expression "While" you can repeat process steps over and over again. Example: As long as the test expression is true the block would be processed. If the test expression is false then the next process step after the while block will be conducted. Loops can also go forever, or at least as long as they are not stopped by the user or the computer itself due to system limitation. It is also possible to stop a look automatically even If the test expression is true by using a break time. Example:

          <p>
             Bugs are part of every software development project. Hence the correction of them is part of the daily routine of every programmer. To correct bugs there are several possibilities you can use:<br>   1. Examine error messages when program crash <br>    a. The last line of python tracebacks provides information of what went wrong. If you read the message backwards then you can identify where to find the problem<br>  2. Work from example code<br>    a. If your individual code does not work then take that part out and try to use example code and which you can modify step by step until it does what you want.<br>  3. Make sure examples work<br>    a. Not all examples you find in the web are correct. You should always test example code first do ensure that it does what you want.<br>  4. Check (print) intermediate results<br>    a. If the code does not provide the expected outcome without crashing then add print statements to the program to see part results and to identify from which point on the program starts being incorrect.<br>  5.  Keep and compare old versions<br>    a. Old versions of your programs should always be saved so that you always have a fall-back version. There are programs which help you with the administration of old version like Git-hub.

             Modular code means that you separate the data from its visual presentation. The advantages are that you can change one of it without influencing the other and that is becomes easier to remain the overview of your coding. However this requires systematic thinking and a clear plan to solve the problem:<br>  - Understand the requirments of the problem by identifying the inputs and defining the outputs.<br>  - Plan an approach to solve the problem and try to break down big tasks into smaller pieces<br>  - Re-familiarize yourself with the code you have already written and which can be useful for as many parts of the problem as possible.<br>  - Write new functions to solve pieces of the bigger problems<br>  - Put all pieces together to check if the whole program works<br><br>A good example can be found in the presentation on the Udacity website under the following <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud552-nd/l-3573808959/m-3655698694">link</a>.

          <p>
             Strings are kind of structured data which can be broken down into their characters. However they are limited to characters. Instead of strings you can use lists which are much more powerful due to the wide range of possibilities. In lists you can use all kinds of elements like strings, numbers or lists inside a list. By using indexes you can just get one element of a list.

        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
             Another big difference between strings and lists is that lists can be mutated. You can easily change the values of a list after you created it. If you replace one part of the list it still remains the same list just with a replaced element while if you redefine a variable with another string a total new variable is created. The mutation of a list can be done in two different way. First by using "append" (e.g. mylist.append(6)) and second by "+=" (e.g. mylist += [6]). If you do not want to mutate a list, just to enhance it for one procedure then you have to use the function form ""list" = "list" + [whatever]. One more big difference is that a list can be connected to two different variables. Changing a parameter by one of them would also change it for the other variable.

          <p>
             With the expression "for "variable" in "list"" you can create a loop function for a list. The variable gets defined in the for-expression. The following body of the function contains the coding which gets assigned to every element of the list.

             There are three possibilities to index the content of a list. First one is ""list".index("value")" which finds the position of a required value. If the value does not exist the output is an error. The second one is ""value" in "list"" which returns True or False. The third one is "value" not in "list" which also returns True or False.

          <p>
             If you want to automate a process with a program it is quite normal that there are complex problems to solve. So do not panic and proceed in a structured way. All programs have input parameters which have relationships with each other and desired outputs. So the first step is to clarify what is the set of valid input parameters. Then you have to clarify what is the desired output. For a better understanding it makes sense to work on some examples how the program should work under specific conditions. Afterwards you should write down the structure as pseudo code (e.g. if this, then that, else something). Keep an eye on finding simple mechanical solutions. Afterwards you can start with coding.
