            The <span class="bold">World Wide Web (www)</span> consists of <span class="italic">HTML</span> (hyper text markup language) documents. These documents are connected via hyper links with each other. It works like this: The user sends a request by the browser on his computer via the internet to the server and receives the documents. The request are done with <span class="italic">HTTP</span> (hypertext transfer protocol). If you need more information about the internet just have a look at this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723400">video</a>

            At the beginning you always start as a <span class="italic">novice</span>. To become an <span class="italic">expert</span> you have to pass several stages. As a <span class="bold">novice</span> you are at the stage of <span class="bold">ignorance</span>. Means you even don't know what you don't know. As soon as you entered the topic and get some ideas of it you are getting at the stage of <span class="bold">awareness</span> which means that you know what you don't know. From <span class="italic">ignorance</span> to <span class="italic">awareness</span> normally takes only short time, maybe minutes. After learning the key skills you are getting at the stage of <span class="bold">ability</span>. This can takes some days, weeks or months. After you got the <span class="italic">ability</span> it takes maybe years to get an <span class="bold">expert</span> by practicing your skills permanently.Another way to understand learning is to identify the differences between a novice and an expert. There is a <span class="italic">knowledge</span> and a <span class="italic">skills</span> gap. The knowledge gap can be closed by <span class="bold">reflection</span> and the skills gap by <span class="bold">practice</span>.

            During studying it is quite normal to be <span class="italic">confused or frustrated</span>. However you have to watch out that it doesn't turn into something worse like <span class="italic">disappointment, anger or terror</span>. To avoid that there are three possibilities: Ask for help, have a break or just go on.

        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
            Building a fancy website happens in several levels. For the strucure and the content of the website you use <span class="bold">HTML</span>. HTML works with tags which can also include other tags between the opening and closing tags. The style of the elements (opening tag + content + closing tag) is done in the language <span class="bold">CSS</span> (comparable with the decoration in a house). For interactive elements you use the language <span class="bold">java script</span>. The coding elements of a website can be seen with the <span class="italic">developer tools</span> of <span class="italic">Google Chrome</span>.

          <h3>How to build a website</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
            The coding of websites is organized in <span class="italic">tree-like-structures</span>. Each element is in one line. This structure is called <span class="bold">Document Object Model (DOM)</span>. For the handling of the different elements on the website you use <span class="bold">boxes</span>. In the HTML code these are signed with the tag <span class="italic">DIV</span>. Using boxes makes it much easier to reorganize the different elements on your website and to remain an overview. Boxes are always <span class="italic">rectangular</span> even if they look like a circle or something else. The layout is done in <span class="italic">CSS</span>. Regularly you use boxes in  boxes in boxes <span class="italic">(from big to small)</span>. Another method to remain an overview of your coding is to <span class="bold">label</span> your boxes so that you still know what is in it. This is especially relevant if you use images and other objects with cryptic names like "pic1". Labels are done by using <span class="italic">"class="</span> within the <span class="italic">DIV tag</span>.

        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
            As the style of the HTML document comes from a <span class="bold">CSS</span> file these have to be linked with each other. However first of all you have to give the computer some information like that it is an HTML document, the head and link to the CSS file and the starting point of the body. The right way to do that can be seen in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-3614428682/m-2603798584">video</a>.

        </div>
        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
            A <span class="italic">cascade structure</span> is a break down structure from big to small.It actually works like a waterfall (e.g. national law – state law – city law – house rules). A big advantage of CSS is the possibility of <span class="bold">inheritance</span>. Same structure-parts can be grouped with the same name by using the parameter <span class="italic">“class”</span> and for these you can set the same style rules. This functionality <span class="italic">avoids a lot of unnecessary repeated coding</span> which means less work and less complexity. In general descendant elements inherit text-related properties like colour, font, letter spacing and so on. But there are also properties which cannot be inherited like background, border and display.

          <p>
            How to include CSS style in my web page. There are actually three methods:<br>
            1.  <span class="bold">Write CSS in the head of the html file</span>. This is good for small projects.<br>
            2.  <span class="bold">Link the HTML file to a separate CSS file</span>. This is good for larger projects due to the better organization.<br>
            3.  <span class="bold">Write the style inline with your HTML</span>. This is not suggested because of much unnecessary code and the high effort of keeping it up to date.

            1.  <span class="bold">Content</span><br>
            2.  <span class="bold">Padding</span>: Clears the area around the content<br>
            3.  <span class="bold">Border</span>: is inherited from the colour of the box<br>

        </div>
        <div class="concept-content">
          <p>
            The box size is equal to the <span class="italic">sum of the boarder, the padding and the content</span>. The size can be written in pixels (px) or percentage. Additional you can use max width to ensure that it the box won’t destroy your layout. Another possibility is that instead of adjusting each single size of the box parts after any small change you can use the CSS code <span class="italic">“box-sizing: border-box”</span>. However you have to consider two things. First, margin is not included and second, it is a relatively new code and it has to be adjusted for different browsers. How to do that you can see in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-2771378569/m-2792478544">video</a>.
